                Some of you may remember our first ChicagoVeg Singles event at Heartland Cafe.
                It was where and when Siri and Ami met back in December, 2010. Many of you may have met them at many ChicagoVeg subsequent events (Siri was helping to organize many of them!) which they mostly attended together. They got married on May 12, 2012 and, as of now, are house hunting for their new home. We wish them a happy and a long lasting relationship together!
