       <p class="subtext">
                While organizers do our best to provide free/low cost events, there are costs to cover the group's maintenance (monthly Meetup.com fees, marketing and other expenses add up to a substantial amount). In order to keep our events and membership free we're asking our members to suggest possible sponsors for our group.
</p>
        <p class="subtext">
Our group offers a great opportunity for local businesses that serve the local community to increase their visibility without hurting their budget. For a little support (that would help cover our monthly and other expenses) local businesses would be able to advertise as a proud sponsor of our community group and, most importantly, they will have a low-cost "targeted" advertisement as we will place the company logo and web site in the sponsorship areas of this and our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoVeg">meetup website </a> (which currently has over 3,500 members).
        </p>
        <p class="subtext">
On the top of these benefits, there are a number of additional opportunities to make the sponsorship even more effective: offering perks, discounts, specials, presentations, and more!
</p>
        <p class="subtext">
Please <a href="contact.html">contact us </a> for any questions/suggestions or sponsorship referrals.
