                ChicagoVeg was founded on June 23, 2009 through the merger of two Meetup groups: Chicago Vegans and Chicago Vegetarians (the both groups were established in 2006). The idea was to bring together all activists, enthusiasts, and supporters of plant-based diet whether they are vegetarians, vegans, raw foodists or just veg-curious regardless of their reasons (ethical, environmental, health, spiritual, etc.).
                <br>
                <br>
                We are truly an all-inclusive and non-judgmental group that happily reaches to all allies to fulfill its mission.
                <br>
                <br>
                ChicagoVeg rapidly grew from just a few hundred members' group to the largest Chicagoland 
                Vegan &amp; Vegetarian group with over 8,000 members 
                (check <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ChicagoVeg/" target="_blank"> meetup.com/ChicagoVeg</a> 
                for the current number) and over 7,000 Facebook fans (<a href="http://www.Facebook.com/ChicagoVeg" target="_blank">facebook.com/ChicagoVeg</a>). 
                ChicagoVeg became the largest Vegan & Vegetarian meetup group in the Midwest and one of the largest groups in the world!
                <br>

                <br>
                ChicagoVeg also made history by organizing the very first <a href="http://chicago.veggiepride.com"  target="_blank">Chicago
                   Veggie Pride Parade (CVPP)</a>.
                 It's both a
                 lot of fun and work that translates to promoting veg*n lifestyle.
                <br>
                <br>
                2012 was a landmark year as ChicagoVeg finally broke off from being just a Meetup group by taking the giant leap and becoming an official not-for-profit organization in order to more effectively carry out its mission to support the local veg community and promote a plant-based diet.
                <br><br>
                ChicagoVeg is an official 501c3 non-profit organization. ChicagoVeg EIN: 46-1670886.
