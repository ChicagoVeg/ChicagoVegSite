<p class="subtext">
  ChicagoVeg is occasionally approached with offers or requests to promote various products, services, events or just specific information. We created the following policy to address this matter:
</p>

  <p class="subtext">
  Any announcements or distributing of any (sales/promotional/informational) materials at our events without getting prior approval from the group organizer are not permitted. Please submit your request for an approval (including the materials you would like to distribute) at least 5 days before the event.
</p>

  <p class="subtext">
  We are sensitive to the fact that many of our members get too many emails therefore we are very conscious about the number of emails we send to our members. We send emails with information only related to our group (ChicagoVeg events, news, etc.).
</p>
  
  <p class="subtext">
  If a member represents a business, they may consider being our sponsor. If sponsorship is accepted, we will feature their logo and link to their website in the sponsorship area on every page of ChicagoVeg website. 
  For more info about becoming a sponsor, please see our <a href="https://chicagoveg.com/sponsorus.html"> sponsors page</a>.
</p>

  <p class="subtext">
  If you have any questions, comments, or concerns you, contact us at our <a href="https://chicagoveg.com/contact.html"> contact page</a>.
