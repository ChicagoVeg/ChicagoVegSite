          Welcome to ChicagoVeg â€“ Chicagoland Vegetarian, Vegan, Raw Foodist
          Community!
        </h3>
        <p className="">
          ChicagoVeg is the largest Chicagoland community for vegetarians,
          vegans, and raw foodists to socialize and meet like-minded people.
          We organize a range of fun activities and outreach events in the
          city and the suburbs. We welcome everyone who is interested in a
          vegan/vegetarian/raw lifestyle for any reason - ethical,
          environmental, health, or spiritual. We support a nonjudgmental
          community where everyone can feel welcome to express their opinions,
          socialize, and have fun! Some of the fun activities include the
          following: exchanging vegan recipes, vegan potlucks, dining out at
          local vegetarian/vegan/raw restaurants, lectures pertaining to the
          vegetarian/vegan/raw lifestyle, and outreach events that promote a
          vegan lifestyle. We see the importance of educating others about
          advantages of a veg*n lifestyle, and we believe that a supportive
          community is vitally important to sustain a veg*n culture.
