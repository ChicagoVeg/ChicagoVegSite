          ChicagoVeg Outreach is an extension of ChicagoVeg â€“ Chicagoland
          Vegetarian, Vegan, & Raw Food Community.
        </p>
        <p className="">
          The mission of the ChicagoVeg Outreach is to enable members to make a
          positive difference by educating others that we can all live happy and
          healthy lives following a vegan/vegetarian diet. We know there are
          numerous benefits of a plant-based diet: health benefits, ethical
          reasons, and ecological advantages.
        </p>
        <h3>Why ChicagoVeg Outreach?</h3>
        <p className="">
          ChicagoVeg Outreach will provide the opportunity for members to turn
          their knowledge and compassion into actively educating the public.
        </p>

        <h3>
            3 factors that make ChicagoVeg Outreach different:
        </h3>
        <ul className="">
          <li>
            ChicagoVeg supports a non-judgmental environment where everybody is
            welcome to join in the outreach meetups regardless of their diet,
            lifestyle, or philosophy.
          </li>
          <li>
            The focus of the outreach meetups will be on what we support, not
            what we are against.
          </li>
          <li>
            Our outreach meetups will be focused on delivering our message and
            having an additional social/fun time for the participants. This
            group is perfect for vegans, vegetarians, animal, health and
            environmental activists; or anyone who supports them to make the
            difference around us and in the world! "Think globally - Act
            locally!"
          </li>
        </ul>
