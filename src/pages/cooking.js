          ChicagoVeg Cooking is all about tasty plant-based food, sharing
          knowledge and cooking experiences between members, educating each
          other about the many benefits of veg*n cooking and how to make it fun,
          and of course about making new like-minded friends!
        </p>

        <p className="">
          While we have a broad scope including Vegetarian, Vegan Cooked, and
          Raw/Living Vegan Food, we will mostly focus on a general whole food
          vegan diet as the source of tasty food and a healthy lifestyle. It has
          been shown by numerous research studies* that an appropriately planned
          vegan diet may prevent and reverse such devastating health problems
          such as Heart Disease, Cancer, and Diabetes, to name a few. What else
          can we wish from our food if not a combination of being tasty,
          healthy, and fun?!

          ChicagoVeg Cooking is an extension of ChicagoVeg â€“ Community for
          Chicagoland Vegetarians, Vegans, Raw Foodists, and their friends. It
          was born as a joint venture between ChicagoVeg and Lincoln Park
          WholeFoods Wellness Club (previous pilot program) to spread and
          popularize the vegan diet in the Chicago area.

          is interested in tasty and healthy plant-based cooking to join us!
