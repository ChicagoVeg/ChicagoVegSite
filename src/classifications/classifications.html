A Vegetarian is someone who follows a plant-based diet. There are five general types of vegetarians:
<br /><br />
1. <strong>Semi-Vegetarians (Flexitarians)</strong><br /> 
Flexitarians limit their intake of either certain types of meat or the amount of meat. Many vegetarians would argue that Flexitarians are not Vegetarians at all.
<br /><br />
2. <strong>Ovo-Lacto Vegetarians (Vegetarians)</strong><br /> 
Ovo-lacto vegetarians do not eat any meat (animals, poultry, fish, sea food) but do eat eggs and dairy products.<br /><br />
Subcategories: <br />
- Ovo vegetarians eat eggs but not dairy<br />
- Lacto vegetarians eat dairy but not eggs (This is the most common type of Vegetarians)
<br /><br />
3. <strong>"Strict" Vegetarians (Vegans)</strong><br /> 
Vegans eat no animal products - no eggs, no dairy, no honey, etc. 
<br /><br />
4. <strong>Raw Food Vegetarians (Raw/Living Foodists)</strong><br /> 
Raw or Living Foodists eat only raw vegan food, because enzymes are destroyed by normal cooking processes. 
<br /><br />
5. <strong>Fruitarians</strong><br /> 
Fruitarians eat only fruit, fruit-like vegetables (e.g., tomatoes, cucumbers), and sometimes seeds and nuts.
