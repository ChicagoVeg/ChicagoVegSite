		ChicagoVeg Outreach is an extension of <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoVeg/?https=off" target="_blank">ChicagoVeg </a> – Chicagoland Vegetarian, Vegan, & Raw Food Community.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="bold">	The mission of the ChicagoVeg Outreach is to enable members make a positive difference by educating others that we can all live happy and healthy lives following vegan/vegetarian diet. </span>We know there are numerous benefits of plant-based diet: health benefits, ethical reasons, and ecological advantages. Here is a small but compact list of some reasons: <span class="bold"> Why Veg. </span> ChicagoVeg Outreach will provide the opportunity for members to turn their knowledge and compassion into actively educating the public.
	</p>

	<p>
		Three factors that make the ChicagoVeg Outreach different:
	</p>

	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				ChicagoVeg supports a non-judgmental environment where everybody is welcome to join in the outreach meetups regardless of their diet, lifestyle, or philosophy.
			</li>

			<li>
				The focus of the outreach meetups will be on what we support, not what we are against.
			</li>

			<li>
				Our outreach meetups will be focused on delivering our message and having an additional social/fun time for the participants.
				This group is perfect for vegans, vegetarians, animal, health and environmental activists; or anyone who supports them to make the difference around us and in the world! "Think globally - Act locally!"
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
		Please watch for our upcoming events to participate in raising consciousness in our community. For any questions, suggestions, or if you would like to help organizing ChicagoVeg Outreach events please contact the group Organizers
