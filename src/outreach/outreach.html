		ChicagoVeg Outreach is an extension of ChicagoVeg â€“ Chicagoland Vegetarian, Vegan, & Raw Food Community.
	</p>
	
	<p class="subtext">The mission of the ChicagoVeg Outreach is to enable members to make a positive difference by educating others that we can all live happy and healthy lives following a vegan/vegetarian diet. We know there are numerous benefits of a plant-based diet: health benefits, ethical reasons, and ecological advantages.</p><p class="subtext"><strong> Why Veg?</strong></p>
	<p class="subtext">ChicagoVeg Outreach will provide the opportunity for members to turn their knowledge and compassion into actively educating the public.

	<p class="subtext">
		<strong>3 factors that make ChicagoVeg Outreach different:</strong>
	</p>
		<ul class="subtext">
			<li>
				ChicagoVeg supports a non-judgmental environment where everybody is welcome to join in the outreach meetups regardless of their diet, lifestyle, or philosophy.
			</li>

			<li>
				The focus of the outreach meetups will be on what we support, not what we are against.
			</li>

			<li>
				Our outreach meetups will be focused on delivering our message and having an additional social/fun time for the participants. This group is perfect for vegans, vegetarians, animal, health and environmental activists; or anyone who supports them to make the difference around us and in the world! "Think globally - Act locally!"
			</li>
		</ul>
