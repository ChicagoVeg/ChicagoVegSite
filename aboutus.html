                                        ChicagoVeg is the largest Chicagoland community for vegetarians, vegans, and raw foodists to socialize and meet like-minded people. We organize a range of fun activities and outreach events in the city and the suburbs. We welcome everyone who is interested
                                        in a vegan/vegetarian/raw lifestyle for any reason - ethical, environmental, health, or spiritual. We support a nonjudgmental community where everyone can feel welcome to express their opinions, socialize, and have
                                        fun! Some of the fun activities include the following: exchanging vegan recipes, vegan potlucks, dining out at local vegetarian/vegan/raw restaurants, lectures pertaining to the vegetarian/vegan/raw lifestyle, and
                                        outreach events that promote a vegan lifestyle. We see the importance of educating others about advantages of a veg*n lifestyle, and we believe that a supportive community is vitally important to sustain a veg*n
                                        culture.
                                    </p>

                                        tons of fun, the <a href="http://chicago.veggiepride.com">Chicago Veggie Pride Parade (CVPP) </a> is a wonderful all-encompassing event to support local vegans and vegetarians, as well as to raise awareness in the general public about the benefits of a plant-based
                                        diet. We encourage everyone, vegans or not vegans, to come and walk, socialize, learn, and of course celebrate the Vegan/Vegetarian lifestyle with us!
