<p class="subtext">
  A potluck means that everyone brings some food/drink to share. Below are ChicagoVeg guidelines for our potlucks. If you are coming without any food (bringing a bag of potato chips is not an option) please contact potluck organizer first.
  <ol class="subtext">
    <li>You should bring enough food or beverage to serve at least 6 people. The vegetarian food you bring can be prepared by you or bought from a store/restaurant as long as you know ALL the ingredients.</li>
    <li> Mark a vegetarian food that you bring: 
      <ul>
      <li>. "D" if it contains any any animal products (dairy, eggs, honey, etc.), "V" if it's totally Vegan (no animal products), "R" for Raw Vegan food.</li>
      <li> Please list ingredients in case someone has some allergies.</li>
      <li>. Put your name â€“ someone may want to ask you for the recipe or have other questions.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
<li> To better accommodate others please consider bringing totally Vegan food (no animal products) or event Raw food if possible.</li>
<li> As you RSVP add a note with a short description indicating what you plan to bring (don't bring something that many others plan to bring)</li>
<li> Bring serving utensils for your dish and tableware (whatever you/your guests may want to use).</li>
<li> No tobacco, alcohol, or other intoxicants please. If any questions see: <a href="/nointoxicants.html">No Intoxicants Policy</a></li>
<li> For outdoor potlucks you may wish to consider bringing the following: folding chair, blanket, sunscreen, swimsuit (for tanning or swimming), balls, frisbees, or any other games you would like to play with others.</li>
 <br />   
    Please <a href="https://chicagoveg.com/contact.html">contact us </a> with any additional questions or concerns.
